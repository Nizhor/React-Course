Intro:

- Keep console open at all time when developing

HTTP GET:

- HTTP GET is a protocol used by the browser and the web server to communicate with each other.
- HTTP GET is used to retrieve the content of a page from the server.
- HTTP GET is part of the HTTP protocol.

Traditional Web Application:

- Traditional web applications are server-side applications where the server contains all application logic.
- The browser only requests content in HTML form from the server.
- The content on the page is static and does not change without a refresh.

Application Logic to be Executed in the Browser:

- Application logic executed in the browser is used to improve the user experience by making web applications more interactive.
- JavaScript is commonly used to execute application logic in the browser.
- Application logic in the browser can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) to change the content of the page dynamically.

Event Handler and Callback:

- Event handlers and callbacks are commonly used mechanisms for code execution in JavaScript.
- An event handler is a piece of code that is executed when a specific event occurs.
- A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when the function completes.

Document Object Model or DOM:

- The Document Object Model (DOM) is the API that allows JavaScript to interact with the page.
- The DOM is a tree-like structure of nodes and elements representing the HTML document.
- JavaScript can manipulate the DOM to change the content of the page dynamically.

Document Object and Page Manipulation from the Console:

- The browser console can be used to manipulate the DOM and the content of the page.
- JavaScript code can be executed in the console to manipulate the content of the page.
- This is a powerful tool for web developers, as it allows them to experiment with different ways of manipulating the page without having to modify the code directly.

CSS:

- CSS is used to style the content of the page.
- CSS can be used to change the appearance of the page, including the font size, color, and layout.
- CSS can also be used to create responsive designs that adjust to different screen sizes and devices.

Loading a Page with JavaScript - Repeat:

- AJAX is a technique used to load data from a server without having to refresh the entire page.
- AJAX can be used to load content into the page without a full refresh.
- This is useful for creating more responsive web applications, as it allows data to be loaded in the background without disrupting the user experience.

Form and HTTP POST:

- HTTP POST is used to send data from the browser to the server.
- Forms are commonly used to send data to the server, such as login credentials or search queries.
- HTTP POST is part of the HTTP protocol.

AJAX:

- AJAX is a technique used to load data from a server without having to refresh the entire page.
- AJAX can be used to load content into the page without a full refresh.
- This is useful for creating more responsive web applications, as it allows data to be loaded in the background without disrupting the user experience.

Single Page App:

- A Single Page App (SPA) is a web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with the app.
- SPAs use AJAX to load content dynamically, which allows data to be loaded in the background without disrupting the user experience.
- SPAs provide a more responsive user experience than traditional web applications.

JavaScript Libraries:

- JavaScript libraries can be used to simplify the development process and provide additional functionality.
- Popular JavaScript libraries include jQuery, React, and Vue.
- JavaScript libraries can help to speed up development by providing pre-written code with common functionality.

Full Stack Web Application Development:

- Full stack web application development refers to the development of both front-end and back-end components of a web application.
- Full stack developers are proficient in both front-end and back-end development.
- Full stack development requires knowledge of multiple technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and server-side programming languages such as PHP or Python.

JavaScript Fatigue:

- JavaScript fatigue refers to the frustration and exhaustion that can arise from the rapid pace of change in the JavaScript ecosystem.
- Keeping up with new developments in the JavaScript ecosystem can be challenging.
- Many developers find it difficult to keep up with the latest trends and technologies in JavaScript development.

Missions:

- The Missions section of the document contains exercises for the reader to reinforce their understanding of the concepts covered.
- Missions provide hands-on experience with web development concepts.
- They are a valuable resource for anyone learning web development.
